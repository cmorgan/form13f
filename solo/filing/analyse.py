Analyses parse.Form13F calculating metrics given in brief: "Data Exercise for
IM Developer Role.docx"

From brief:

2. Retrieve the following information (for all of these tasks assume common
stock is classified as "COM" in the Title of Class field):

a) What was the total value of all common stock positions in the fund for each
quarter? Did the fund grow or fall in value with respect to its common stock
positions over the 4 quarters?

b) What would have been the 5 largest holdings of common stock that were
publically available on 12 August 2012 for the fund manager? 

c) As at 12/31/2012, what were the fund's 3 biggest new common stock positions
(stocks it had not held in the previous quarter)?
